# Dev Challenge3 / Cheesecake recipe site


One of my dev challenge practice projects

## Process:

I was still pretty new to web dev, when I made this, I was still figuring out HTML and CSS, and i had just started with JS


- icons were a pain point for me until I learned to work eith them


2. Icons.

- Icons and svgs were a bit troublesome to work with me when i was starting out, this was great to overcome that and make a very nice page

3. Custom bullet points

- the custom bullet points were another challenge i did not realize there was not a "straight foward" way to just change the bullet points. but it was really fun to learn 

thanks for reading!
